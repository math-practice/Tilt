    <!-- <h2>Tilt — Neon</h2>
    <p>Tilt is a family of type inspired by the dimensional lettering found in storefront signage, designed by Andy Clymer. It’s comprised of three separate subfamilies of type, drawn in styles that you might find in a storefront — All three are based around the same letter model of a sign painter’s geometric sans serif, similar to the typefaces Futura or Avant Garde, but with the kinds of details you might expect when the letter is built up with a brush.</p>
    <p>The three styles are designed and built as variable fonts, however instead of using common axes such as “Weight” and “Width”, these typefaces will allow users to rotate the orientation of their glyphs with “Horizontal Rotation” and “Vertical Rotation” axes. The rotation is limited to ±45° so that the letterforms never rotate past a range of readibility.</p>
